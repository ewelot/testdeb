## Installation of binary packages

Binary packages are provided for two Linux distributions:
- Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) and variants like XUbuntu
- Debian 8 (Jessie)

Currently there is no public apt package repository. The binary package files
are hosted on a GitHub repository instead. The installation procedure is as
follows:
- Download the
  [install script](https://github.com/ewelot/airtools/raw/master/install_deb.sh)
- Locate the file in your download folder
- Open a terminal window in the download folder
- Run the install script by the command: `sudo bash install_deb.sh`


## Compiling and Installation from source code

If there is no binary package repository for your distribution then you
have to compile the software and install it afterwards. The compilation depends
on a number of libraries. On a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution they can be
installed via:

    apt-get install libnetpbm10-dev libjasper-dev libjpeg-dev libcfitsio3-dev \
        libtiff5-dev libfftw3-dev libblas-dev libatlas-base-dev \
        libplplot-dev plplot12-driver-xwin plplot12-driver-cairo libshp-dev \
        libcurl4-gnutls-dev

If you are compiling from source packages you must also install the
required build tools:

    apt-get install build-essential fakeroot devscripts debhelper \
        javahelper dh-autoreconf

Example compilation:
    ...

Example installation:
    ...


## Documentation

Documentation is available under the `/usr/share/doc/airtools-doc/` directory
after successful installation of the binary packages. The same content is
visible on GitHub's
[doc directory](doc/).


## Known Problems

No plots during "Astrometric calibration":

Several check plots are generated by the underlying `scamp` program. This
might fail due to a buggy plplot driver which is shipped on some Linux
distributions. Solution: Remove the offending package by
`sudo apt-get remove plplot12-driver-qt`.
