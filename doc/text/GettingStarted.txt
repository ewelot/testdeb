1. Preparation
----------------

All basic astronomical image processing from raw uncalibrated CCD or DSLR
images to final stacked images could be done by AIRTOOLS commands. But this is
not covered in this guide because most users do already have their own pipeline
using other - more commonly used - software to achieve the same results.

It is required that the resulting stacked images have a linear response between
collected photons and measured counts (ADU). Ideally the counts should be at
approximately the same level as in a single raw (unprocessed) image optionally
stretched to the 16bit range if the detector has lower bit depth.
Moreover it is strongly advised to not subtract any background (e.g. gradients)
at this stage.

At the end of your comet image processing you should have created two stacked
images: one centered on stars (hereafter referred to as star stack) and another
one centered on the comet (called comet stack).



2. Metadata files
-------------------

The following metadata files must be present in the working directory:
set.dat    - observations data file
camera.dat - telescope and camera data file
sites.dat  - observatory sites data file
refcat.dat - reference catalog meta data

Templates of those files are provided under the directory
/usr/share/airtools/


2.1 The observations data file
--------------------------------

Usually an observation of a single target consists of multiple bracketed
exposures - called an image set. Each set is represented by a line in the
observations data text file set.dat. It consits of the following fields
(separated by spaces):
- approx start time
- a short set name
- the target
- an image type letter: o=object d=dark/bias f=flat
- exposure time in seconds
- first image number (individual images have 4-digit numbers)
- last image number
- reference image number
- name of dark image (without extension)
- name of flat field image (without extension)
- telescope identifier (as defined in camera.dat)
- optional notes


2.2 Supplemental metadata files
---------------------------------

Because of the widely spread sets of keywords used in FITS image headers
as created by different image acquisition and data reduction software
we need to define a common set of additional user provided data.

At first you are required to add some information about your telescope/camera
setup to the file camera.dat. It is text file containing tabular data
and each setup is later referenced by its unique telescope identifier (the
first field).

In addition, basic data describing the location of your observatory site
must be added to the file sites.dat. Either the site identifier (first field)
or the location (second field) can be used when setting the AI_SITE variable
(see below).

There is no need to edit the refcat.dat text file.



3. Application initialization and GUI startup
-----------------------------------------------

3.1 Initialization
--------------------

Start a new terminal emulator window which should come up with a BASH shell
prompt. You must define a minimal set of environment variables:
    day       ... the local date for start of night in the format yymmdd
    AI_RAWDIR ... directory of raw data files
    AI_TMPDIR ... directory to store temporary files
    AI_SITE   ... your site as defined in sites.dat

Example commands:
    export day=160224
    export AI_RAWDIR=./
    export AI_TMPDIR=/tmp
    export AI_SITE=MyLocation

Load AIRTOOLS shell functions:

    . airfun.sh


3.2 Converting images
-----------------------

Most likely your stacked images are in FITS format. The AIRTOOLS software
natively operates on Netpbm image file formats (PGM for monochrome, PPM for
RGB images). This has originally been decided on to best suit programs like
ImageMagick and Netpbm toolkits and to handle DSLR images in first place.

The conversion of your FITS images and a check of basic header information
is done by using the command line program AIstart:

    AIstart <setname> <star_stack>.fits <comet_stack>.fits

It creates three files in the current directory
    star stack PNM image:   <setname>.pgm or <setname>.ppm
    comet stack PNM image:  <setname>_m.pgm or <setname>_m.ppm
    ASCII header file:      <setname>.head

The new image file extension is "pgm" for monochrome input FITS images and
"ppm" in case of RGB images.

The program AIstart checks some basic image header keywords. It might report
some errors which should be fixed by running the command

    set_header <setname>.head <keyword>=<value>


3.3 GUI startup
-----------------

All tasks required for large aperture photometry of comets are implemented
as analysis tasks in the SAOImage display GUI which is started by the command

    AIexamine <setname>.pgm <setname>_m.pgm &

(note: for RGB images change image file extensions to ppm).

The AIRTOOLS tasks are now available from the "Analysis" menu (bottom entries).



4. Comet photometry
---------------------

The usual processing pipeline involves the following steps:
- Astrometric calibration
- Background gradient removal
- PSF extraction
- Comet extraction
- Photometrc calibration

After finishing your image reduction, you may savely remove some temporary
files (name prefix x) from your working directory.



5. Sample data
----------------

Sample images of a comet observation are provided by the following archive file

Download the file and unpack (double click starts archiver program) into a new
directory.
