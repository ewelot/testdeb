Installation of binary packages
--------------------------------

Binary packages are provided for two Linux distributions:
- Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) and variants like XUbuntu
- Debian 8 (Jessie)

Installation from public package repository:
Not yet available.

Alternative installation from GitHub repository:
- Download install script from
    https://github.com/ewelot/airtools/raw/master/install_deb.sh
- Open terminal window in your download folder
- Run the install script by the command:
    sudo bash install_deb.sh


Compiling and Installation from source code
--------------------------------------------

If there is no binary package repository for your distribution then you
have to compile the software and install it afterwards. The compilation depends
on a number of libraries. On a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution they can be
installed via:

    apt-get install libnetpbm10-dev libjasper-dev libjpeg-dev libcfitsio3-dev \
        libtiff5-dev libfftw3-dev libblas-dev libatlas-base-dev \
        libplplot-dev plplot12-driver-xwin plplot12-driver-cairo libshp-dev \
        libcurl4-gnutls-dev

If you are compiling from source packages you must also install the
required build tools:

    apt-get install build-essential fakeroot devscripts debhelper \
        javahelper dh-autoreconf

Example compilation:
    ...

Example installation:

Known Bugs
-----------

Troubleshooting of plotting in scamp
If you encounter problems when running the "Astrometric calibration" task
and there is no check plots displayed then this might be caused by a buggy
plplot driver on some Linux systems.
In this case you should remove the package:
    sudo apt-get remove plplot12-driver-qt
